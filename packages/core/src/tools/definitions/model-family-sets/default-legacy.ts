      The user has the ability to modify the \`new_string\` content. If modified, this will be stated in the response.
      
      Expectation for required parameters:
      1. \`old_string\` MUST be the exact literal text to replace (including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.).
      2. \`new_string\` MUST be the exact literal text to replace \`old_string\` with (also including all whitespace, indentation, newlines, and surrounding code etc.). Ensure the resulting code is correct and idiomatic and that \`old_string\` and \`new_string\` are different.
      3. \`instruction\` is the detailed instruction of what needs to be changed. It is important to Make it specific and detailed so developers or large language models can understand what needs to be changed and perform the changes on their own if necessary. 
      4. NEVER escape \`old_string\` or \`new_string\`, that would break the exact literal text requirement.
      **Important:** If ANY of the above are not satisfied, the tool will fail. CRITICAL for \`old_string\`: Must uniquely identify the single instance to change. Include at least 3 lines of context BEFORE and AFTER the target text, matching whitespace and indentation precisely. If this string matches multiple locations, or does not match exactly, the tool will fail.
      5. Prefer to break down complex and long changes into multiple smaller atomic calls to this tool. Always check the content of the file after changes or not finding a string to match.
      **Multiple replacements:** Set \`expected_replacements\` to the number of occurrences you want to replace. The tool will replace ALL occurrences that match \`old_string\` exactly. Ensure the number of replacements matches your expectation.`,

    name: READ_MANY_FILES_TOOL_NAME,
    description: `Reads content from multiple files specified by glob patterns within a configured target directory. For text files, it concatenates their content into a single string. It is primarily designed for text-based files. However, it can also process image (e.g., .png, .jpg), audio (e.g., .mp3, .wav), and PDF (.pdf) files if their file names or extensions are explicitly included in the 'include' argument. For these explicitly requested non-text files, their data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g., base64 encoded).

This tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of files, such as:
- Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files in the 'src' directory).
- Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad questions about code.
- Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs' directory).
- Gathering context from multiple configuration files.
- When the user asks to "read all files in X directory" or "show me the content of all Y files".

Use this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files, it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between file contents. The tool inserts a '--- End of content ---' after the last file. Ensure glob patterns are relative to the target directory. Glob patterns like 'src/**/*.js' are supported. Avoid using for single files if a more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this tool. Other binary files (not explicitly requested as image/audio/PDF) are generally skipped. Default excludes apply to common non-text files (except for explicitly requested images/audio/PDFs) and large dependency directories unless 'useDefaultExcludes' is false.`,

    name: WRITE_TODOS_TOOL_NAME,
    description: `This tool can help you list out the current subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request. The list of subtasks helps you keep track of the current task, organize complex queries and help ensure that you don't miss any steps. With this list, the user can also see the current progress you are making in executing a given task.

Depending on the task complexity, you should first divide a given task into subtasks and then use this tool to list out the subtasks that are required to be completed for a given user request.
Each of the subtasks should be clear and distinct. 

Use this tool for complex queries that require multiple steps. If you find that the request is actually complex after you have started executing the user task, create a todo list and use it. If execution of the user task requires multiple steps, planning and generally is higher complexity than a simple Q&A, use this tool.

DO NOT use this tool for simple tasks that can be completed in less than 2 steps. If the user query is simple and straightforward, do not use the tool. If you can respond with an answer in a single turn then this tool is not required.

## Task state definitions

- pending: Work has not begun on a given subtask.
- in_progress: Marked just prior to beginning work on a given subtask. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.
- completed: Subtask was successfully completed with no errors or issues. If the subtask required more steps to complete, update the todo list with the subtasks. All steps should be identified as completed only when they are completed.
- cancelled: As you update the todo list, some tasks are not required anymore due to the dynamic nature of the task. In this case, mark the subtasks as cancelled.


## Methodology for using this tool
1. Use this todo list as soon as you receive a user request based on the complexity of the task.
2. Keep track of every subtask that you update the list with.
3. Mark a subtask as in_progress before you begin working on it. You should only have one subtask as in_progress at a time.
4. Update the subtask list as you proceed in executing the task. The subtask list is not static and should reflect your progress and current plans, which may evolve as you acquire new information.
5. Mark a subtask as completed when you have completed it.
6. Mark a subtask as cancelled if the subtask is no longer needed.
7. You must update the todo list as soon as you start, stop or cancel a subtask. Don't batch or wait to update the todo list.


## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User request: Create a website with a React for creating fancy logos using gemini-2.5-flash-image

ToDo list created by the agent:
1. Initialize a new React project environment (e.g., using Vite).
2. Design and build the core UI components: a text input (prompt field) for the logo description, selection controls for style parameters (if the API supports them), and an image preview area.
3. Implement state management (e.g., React Context or Zustand) to manage the user's input prompt, the API loading status (pending, success, error), and the resulting image data.
4. Create an API service module within the React app (using "fetch" or "axios") to securely format and send the prompt data via an HTTP POST request to the specified "gemini-2.5-flash-image" (Gemini model) endpoint.
5. Implement asynchronous logic to handle the API call: show a loading indicator while the request is pending, retrieve the generated image (e.g., as a URL or base64 string) upon success, and display any errors.
6. Display the returned "fancy logo" from the API response in the preview area component.
7. Add functionality (e.g., a "Download" button) to allow the user to save the generated image file.
8. Deploy the application to a web server or hosting platform.

<reasoning>
The agent used the todo list to break the task into distinct, manageable steps:
1. Building an entire interactive web application from scratch is a highly complex, multi-stage process involving setup, UI development, logic integration, and deployment.
2. The agent inferred the core functionality required for a "logo creator," such as UI controls for customization (Task 3) and an export feature (Task 7), which must be tracked as distinct goals.
3. The agent rightly inferred the requirement of an API service model for interacting with the image model endpoint.
</reasoning>
</example>


## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
User request: Ensure that the test <test file> passes.

Agent:
<Goes into a loop of running the test, identifying errors, and updating the code until the test passes.>

<reasoning>
The agent did not use the todo list because this task could be completed by a tight loop of execute test->edit->execute test.
